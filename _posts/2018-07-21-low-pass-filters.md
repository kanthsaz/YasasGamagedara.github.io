Low-pass filters are basically an upgrade from the [Averaging filters]({{site.baseurl}}/averaging-filters/).
If you are not familiar with averaging filter, may be it is a good idea to go through them first.

Usually, the noise is in high frequency bands.
The low-pass filter is designed to pass-through low frequency signals, while blocking high frequency signals, hence the name "low-pass filter".

The moving average filter has the same weight for all measurements.
However, in reality, the most recent measurements have more to say about the current state.
The low-pass filter overcome this by using a heavier weight on the most recent data.

The first order low-pass filter can be written as follows with `0 < α < 1`.
```
x_k = α · x_{k - 1} + (1 - α) · x_k
```

This is a bit similar to average filter, but `α` can be set arbitrarily.
Higher `α`  (closer to 1) means less noise, but lags, while lower `α` (closer to 0) means less lag, but noisy.


The first order low-pass filter in Laplace domain is:
```
Y(s) / X(s) = K · (1 / (𝜏s + 1))
```

    <figcaption><i>Comparison between low-pass filter with different α values: high α value (green line with α=0.9) smoothens out the data more but has a lag, low α value (red line with α=0.4) has a lesser lag but affected more by the noise.</i></figcaption>
